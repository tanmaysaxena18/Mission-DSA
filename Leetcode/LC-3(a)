#Top K Frequent Elements
from collections import Counter
class Solution:
    def topKFrequent(self, nums: List[int], k: int) -> List[int]:
         return [num for num, _ in Counter(nums).most_common(k)]
'''
The simplest and most direct alternative is to use the most_common method provided by Counter, which internally does the heavy lifting for you.

How It Works: most_common(k) returns the k most common elements as tuples (element, count), and then the list comprehension extracts the elements
